# Human-Mobility-Analysis

This study aims to demonstrate the mobility pattern analysis at the individual level from geo-location based social networking

With the help of sensors and online networks, mobility analysis can be applied on many different situations and provide insights on individual and collective spatio-temporal patterns in daily life, such as social interactions, mobility at urban and regional scales, social interactions as face-to-face encounters and the spread of biological viruses as epidemic spreading. Human mobility is the underlying social dynamics of population and stands as a core foundation of many problems as urban planning, transportation, environmental
sustainability, diffusion of diseases and intelligent marketing (Lima et al, 2013; Cheshire & Uberti, 2014).

With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, the diffusion of mobile devices gives an unprecedented opportunity to study massive data of human behaviour and build models about the movement of people at different scales. Musolesi
(2014) explains that mining data from smartphones and cellular infrastructure permits to have real time access of detailed knowledge about people, things, and events. 

Network theories can be applied at different levels analysis. Collective analysis as macromobility studies aim to investigate problem as country-wide commuting flows, inter-city mobility and trade between countries like flights and shipping routes. Gravity and radiations
models are classic examples of aggregate mobility models. Conversely, individual-level of network analysis investigates the effects of individual-level on networks. Micro-mobility aims to analyse the relation between individual actors and a network, as for example a
transport network or a social process within a functional scale structure.

This study aims to study the mobility pattern analysis at the individual level of users from Gowalla, an online geo-social network. Implications about privacy concerns are also exposed and commented.
